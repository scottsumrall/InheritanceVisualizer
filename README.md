# Inheritance Visualizer
Exploring visualization of inheritance for modeling and learning

# About
This repo is a personal passion project of mine. It is a work in progress fulll-stack website developed in Blazor with .Net. The goal of this project is to gain hands on experience putting together a REST API and integrating it into an interactable website. I find the concept of inheritance in programming quite interesting and felt that creating a website that models this relationship would be both challenging and intriguing. I believe this project may serve as a valuable educational tool for newer programmers who are struggling to grasp the concept of inheritance.
